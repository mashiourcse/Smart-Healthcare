        description: `Physical exercise is the performance of some activity in order to develop or maintain physical fitness and overall health.

        It is often directed toward also honing athletic ability or skill.
        
        Frequent and regular physical exercise is an important component in the prevention of some diseases such as heart disease, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity.
        
        Exercises are generally grouped into three types depending on the overall effect they have on the human body: Flexibility exercises such as stretching improve the range of motion of muscles and joints; aerobic exercises such as walking and running focus on increasing cardiovascular endurance; and anaerobic exercises such as weight training, functional training or sprinting increase short-term muscle strength.
        
        Physical exercise is considered important for maintaining physical fitness including healthy weight; building and maintaining healthy bones, muscles, and joints; promoting physiological well-being; reducing surgical risks; and strengthening the immune system.

        Good nutrition plays an important role in our lives.

It can help guard against malnutrition and help prevent diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cancer.

Unfortunately, in 2017, many people within Britain have a diet consisting largely of saturated fat, trans fat, sugar and sodium.

They should instead be consuming healthy choices such as fruits and vegetables. The food we put into our bodies reflects onto our health. If you’re an expectant mother, it’s a no-brainer how imperative good nutrition is. To test how much vitamins we have filled in our bodies, tools such as a mothers milk dha test kit can be utilized.

Good nutrition aids the immune system
Nutrition helps us to maintain a healthy immune system.

Our immune system is our defence against diseases, and so poor nutrition can mean we are more prone to these.

By eating foods and taking supplements, such as the ones from www.rootine.co, that are loaded with vitamins and minerals, we are helping to keep our immune system healthy.

A well-balanced diet that consists of fruit, vegetables and low fats will help to keep your immune system strong and healthy and defend against diseases for years to come.

Proper nutrition provides you with more energy
Did you know that our bodies rely on energy that is outsourced from the foods and drinks we consume?

The main nutrients our bodies use for energy are carbohydrates, fats and protein.

You can find carbohydrates in foods such as wholegrain breads and starchy vegetables like potatoes.

These foods digest at a slow rate and therefore offer prolonged energy.

Water is also necessary in order to transport nutrients throughout our bodies, with dehydration from lack of water causing an absence of energy.

Mood
Many people opt for diets that are low in carbohydrates, however, this can be detrimental to your mood.

These diets can increase feelings of tension whereas diets high in carbohydrates tend to have an uplifting effect on moods.

By having a diet that is rich in protein, reasonable carbohydrates and low in fat, you will be obtaining an adequate supply of iron, omega-3 fatty acids and iron, and our moods will be positively affected by this.

Well Being
Eating a nutritional diet can also help with your physical and mental health, as eating healthily allows you to have more energy, and therefore become more active.

Studies have shown that two thirds of people who eat fruit and vegetables every single day report no mental health issues.

Living a longer life
Whilst our bodies need food in order to be healthy and survive, the process our body takes to metabolise causes stress on the body.

By overeating, we are creating more stress and this could potentially lead to a short lifespan if changes are not made.

If we feed our bodies the wrong types of food our lifespan can hugely decline because of this.

By eating diets that are rich in nutrients, and contain little to no processed foods, our lives may be lengthened.

At Perea Clinic we offer nutrition therapy to help you to meet your personal goals and requirements.

        description: `A Rainbow of Medicine
        One medicine might be a pink liquid, another medicine might come in a special mist, another might be a blue pill, and still another might come out of a yellow tube. But they're all used for the same purpose — to make you feel better when you're sick.
        
        Most medicines today are made in laboratories and many are based on things found in nature. After a medicine is created, it is tested over and over in many different ways. This lets scientists make sure it's safe for people to take and that it can fight or prevent an illness.
        
        Some new medicines actually are new versions of old medicines that have been improved to help people feel better quicker.
        
        Medicines Can Replace What's Missing
        Sometimes a part of the body can't make enough of a certain substance, and this can make a person sick. When someone has type 1 diabetes (say: dye-uh-BEE-tees), the pancreas (a body organ that is part of the digestive system) can't make enough of an important chemical called insulin, which the body needs to stay healthy.
        
        If your body makes too much of a certain chemical, that can make you sick too. Luckily, medicines can replace what's missing (like insulin) or they can block production of a chemical when the body is making too much of it.
        
        Most of the time when kids get sick, the illness comes from germs that get into the body. The body's immune system works to fight off these invaders. But the germs and the body's natural way of germ fighting, like getting a fever, can make a person feel ill. In many cases, the right kind of medicine can help kill the germs and help the person feel better.
        
        Medicines Help in Many Ways
        People take medicines to fight illness, to feel better when they're sick, and to keep from getting sick in the first place.
        
        When deciding which medicine to give a patient, a doctor thinks about what is causing the patient's problem. Someone may need to take more than one type of medicine at the same time — one to fight off an infection and one to help the person feel better, for example.
        
        When it comes to fighting illnesses, there are many types of medicines. Antibiotics (say: an-ty-by-AH-tiks) are one type of medicine that a lot of kids have taken. Antibiotics kill germs called bacteria, and different antibiotics can fight different kinds of bacteria. So if your doctor found out that streptococcal bacteria were causing your sore throat, he or she could prescribe just the right antibiotic.
        
        Pain Relievers and Symptom Soothers
        But while the antibiotic is starting to fight the bacteria, you might still feel achy and hot, so the doctor might tell your parent to also give you a pain reliever. Pain relievers can't make you well, but they do help you feel better while you're getting well.
        
        Cream that helps a bug bite stop itching is another example. Your cold had to go away on its own, just like the bug bite needed to heal on its own, but in the meantime, these medicines helped you feel less sick or itchy.
        
        Many people also take medicines to control illnesses that don't completely go away, such as diabetes, asthma, or high blood pressure. With help from these medicines, people can enjoy life and avoid some of the worst symptoms of their illnesses.
        
        Finally, there are important medicines that keep people from getting sick in the first place. Some of these are called immunizations (say: ih-myoo-nuh-ZAY-shunz), and they are usually given as a shot. They prevent people from catching serious illnesses like measles and mumps. There is even an immunization that prevents chickenpox, and many people get a flu shot each fall to avoid the flu. Although shots are never fun, they are a very important part of staying healthy.
        
        Many Ways to Take Medicine
        Medicines are given in different ways, depending on how they work best in the body.
        
        A lot of medicines are swallowed, either as a pill or a liquid. Once the medicine is swallowed, the digestive juices in the stomach break it down, and the medicine can pass into the bloodstream. Your blood then carries it to other parts of your body where the medicine works best.
        
        But some medicines wouldn't work if the stomach's digestive juices broke them down. For example, insulin is given as a shot under the skin and then it can be absorbed into the bloodstream.
        
        Other medicines would take too long to work if they were swallowed. When you get an IV in the hospital the medicine gets into your blood quickly. Other medicines need to be breathed into the lungs where they work best for lung problems, like some of the medicines used to treat asthma.
        
        Still others work best when they are put directly on the spot that needs the medicine — like patting ointment on an infected cut or dropping ear drops into a clogged-up ear.
        
        Mind Your Medicines
        So medicines sound like a pretty good thing, right? In many cases they are — as long as they are used correctly. Too much of a medicine can be harmful, and old or outdated medicines may not work or can make people sick. Taking the wrong medicine or medicine prescribed for someone else is also very bad news.
        
        You should always follow your doctor's instructions for taking medicine — especially for how long. If your doctor says to take medicine for 10 days, take it for the whole time, even if you start to feel better sooner. Those medicines need time to finish the job and make you better!`

        Physical therapy addresses the illnesses or injuries that limit a person's abilities to move and perform functional activities in their daily lives.[6] PTs use an individual's history and physical examination to arrive at a diagnosis and establish a management plan and, when necessary, incorporate the results of laboratory and imaging studies like X-rays, CT-scan, or MRI findings. Electrodiagnostic testing (e.g., electromyograms and nerve conduction velocity testing) may also be used.[7] PT management commonly includes prescription of or assistance with specific exercises, manual therapy, and manipulation, mechanical devices such as traction, education, electrophysical modalities which include heat, cold, electricity, sound waves, radiation, assistive devices, prostheses, orthoses, and other interventions. In addition, PTs work with individuals to prevent the loss of mobility before it occurs by developing fitness and wellness-oriented programs for healthier and more active lifestyles, providing services to individuals and populations to develop, maintain and restore maximum movement and functional ability throughout the lifespan. This includes providing treatment in circumstances where movement and function are threatened by aging, injury, disease, or environmental factors. Functional movement is central to what it means to be healthy. Physical therapy is a professional career which has many specialties including musculoskeletal, orthopedics, cardiopulmonary, neurology, endocrinology, sports medicine, geriatrics, pediatrics, women's health, wound care and electromyography. Neurological rehabilitation is, in particular, a rapidly emerging field. PTs practice in many settings, such as private-owned physical therapy clinics, outpatient clinics or offices, health and wellness clinics, rehabilitation hospitals facilities, skilled nursing facilities, extended care facilities, private homes, education, and research centers, schools, hospices, industrial and these workplaces or other occupational environments, fitness centers and sports training facilities.[8]

Physical therapists also practice in the non-patient care roles such as health policy,[9][10] health insurance, health care administration and as health care executives. Physical therapists are involved in the medical-legal field serving as experts, performing peer review and independent medical examinations.

Education varies greatly by country. The span of education ranges from some countries having little formal education to others having doctoral degrees and post-doctoral residencies and fellowships.

        Meditation may be an ancient tradition, but it’s still practiced in cultures all over the world to create a sense of calm and inner harmony.

        Although the practice has ties to many different religious teachings, meditation is less about faith and more about altering consciousness, finding awareness, and achieving peace.
        
        These days, with the greater need to reduce stress in the midst of our busy schedules and demanding lives, meditation is increasing in popularity.
        
        Although there isn’t a right or wrong way to meditate, it’s important to find a practice that meets your needs and complements your personality.
        
        There are nine popular types of meditation practice:
        
        1. mindfulness meditation 
        2. spiritual meditation
        3. focused meditation
        4. movement meditation
        5. mantra meditation
        6. transcendental meditation
        7. progressive relaxation
        8. loving-kindness meditation
        9. visualization meditation
        
        Not all meditation styles are right for everyone. These practices require different skills and mindsets. How do you know which practice is right for you?
        
        “It’s what feels comfortable and what you feel encouraged to practice,” says Mira Dessy, a meditation author and holistic nutritionist.

        Everyone needs to have their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam.

Getting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat.

The exam includes several tests:

A visual field test to measure your side (peripheral) vision. A loss of peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma.
A visual acuity test, where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away, to check on how well you see at various distances
Tonometry, which measures your eye's interior pressure. It helps to detect glaucoma.
Dilation, which involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye, including the retina, macula, and optic nerve.
If you have a refractive error and are going to need glasses or contacts, then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test, you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision.

At what age you should start getting these exams and how often you need them depends on many factors. They include your age, race, and overall health. For example, if you are African American, you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should get an exam every year. Check with your health care provider about if and when you need these exams.
